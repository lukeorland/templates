This can be used in conjunction with Mendeley as follows:

1. Configure Mendeley: Enable BibTeX syncing
2. Right click on the relevant document row in Medeley, select "Copy Latex Citation"
3. Paste into the markdown text file. One may need to reformat the Latex format `\cite{Acero2000}` to pandoc-markdown format `@Acero2000` (until what I think is a citeproc.hs or pandoc bug gets fixed).
4. Make sure the symlink `library.bib` is pointing to the proper location.
5. Save and run `make`.
