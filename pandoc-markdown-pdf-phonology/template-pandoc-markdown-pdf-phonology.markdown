2. Yidgi\textipa{\*n}, an aboriginal language of Queensland, Australia

    (b) and
    (c) *What are the phonemic forms of the stems and case suffixes below?*
        On first glance, the stem form appears to be very close to the *absolutive* case, since the other forms appear to have a vowel lengthening and suffixes appended in word-final position. I assume that the underlying phonemic form of the stem should be different than the *absolutive* phonetic form so that there is a phonological change indicating *absolutive* form.

        The first few examples, corresponding to the glosses 'woman', 'treetop', 'shark', and 'work', have vowels in word-final position. The *comitative* and *genitive* forms contain a stem that matches the *absolutive* form only with -j/-ji and -n/-ni suffixes, as well as a lengthening of the vowel preceding the appended suffix. Thus, it would appear from these four examples that the underlying stem is the *absolutive* with lengthened final vowel. Something appears to re-shorten the final vowel in the *comitative* + *genitive* form.

        One pattern that seems to hold true throughout all examples from Yidgi\textipa{\*n} is that every vowel in word-final position is short in length, and every vowel that precedes a consonant in word-final position is long in length. These observations may indicated that a final rule that maintains these consistencies is applied after suffixes are applied.

        * **Suffixes**:

            + *Absolutive*:
              No suffix is appended. If the consonant preceding a vowel in word-final position is a stop ([-continuant -sonorant]), the second-to-last vowel is lengthened. Otherwise, stems undergo a deletion of a vowel in word-final position. e.g. biniri $\rightarrow$ bini\textipa{:}r. The final vowel is deleted when it is short in the stem's underlying form.

            + *Comitative*:
              If the stem has a vowel of *long* duration in word-final position, append the suffix -j. If the stem has a vowel of *short* duration in word-final position, append the suffix -ji.

            + *Genitive*:
              If the stem has a vowel of *long* duration in word-final position, append the suffix -n. If the stem has a vowel of *short* duration in word-final position, append the suffix -ni.

            + *Comitative* + *Genitive*:
              If the stem has a vowel of *long* duration in word-final position, append the suffix -jini. If the stem has a vowel of *short* duration in word-final position, append the suffix -jin.

        * **Stems**:

          *stem*                                 *gloss*

        *In order to derive the observed phonetic forms, what phonological rules must apply?*
        *What is the required ordering of the rules, if ordering is necessary?*

        The rules are to be applied in the following order:

        1. Apply the inflection to form the specific case form with the inflection rules above.

        2. A vowel in word-final position is made short in length, and a vowel that precedes a consonant in word-final position is made long in length.

    (d) **Suffixes**:

        * *Dative*: simply append the suffix -nda.

        * *Accusative*: If the vowel in the stem's word-final position is long in length, append the suffix -\textipa{\:n}. If the vowel in the stem's word-final position is short in length, append the suffix -\textipa{\:n}a. No other examples of stems have been observed.

        * *Purposive*: simply append the suffix -nda.

        * *Comitative* + *Apprehensive*: If the vowel in the stem's word-final position is long in length, append the suffix -jida. If the vowel in the stem's word-final position is short in length, append the suffix -\textipa{ji:da}. No other examples of stems have been observed.

        * *"Another"*: simply append the suffix -bi.
